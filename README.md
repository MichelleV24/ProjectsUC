# ProjectsUC
A repo of projects made during my Masters of Applied Data Science 

1. Python recipe App: 

This recipe app uses tkinter to create a recipe app using recipes from the epicurious website. 
The app allows the user to input the recipes available on hand, or allows the generation of a random recipe. 
Contained within is the recipe files and actual .py file to run the app, 'tkinterinclass.py'. Available also is a pdf guide to using the app and commentary on future steps. 

2. Statistics Assignment: 

This assignment was based around exploratory data analysis in R programming language of crime data in New Zealand. I aimed to address the question of whether the type of crime and time of crime occuring differed around different regions of New Zealand between 2021-2022. Included is the final report, starting data and analysis conducted in R markdown file. 

3. Data Science in Industry assignment 1: 

This project involved exploratory data analysis on a given data set using the interactive R shiny program. The R shiny global, server and ui codes are included, alongside a report on the findings. 


4. Data Science in Industry assignment 2: 

This project involves the creation of a R shiny app to explore given covid-19 data, specifically relating to multiple predictor variables and one outcome variable. Exploratory data analysis, data processing and data modelling is performed in the R shiny app, comprised of a global, server and ui codes. A report on the findings accompanies the app. 

5. Data Science in Industry assignment 4: 

Comprised of two seperate issues, this assignment focussed on using mlr3 and control charts in R to explore relevant data sets. Available in rmd and pdf files.
